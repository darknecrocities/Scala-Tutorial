# Scala Tutorial: Beginner to Advanced 🚀

This repository contains a set of Scala tutorials, organized from beginner to advanced levels. The tutorials cover the essential concepts of the Scala programming language, including basic syntax, object-oriented programming, functional programming, and advanced features like concurrency and higher-order functions.

## Contents 📚

1. **Beginner Scala Tutorial**: 🌱 Introduces basic concepts like variables, conditionals, loops, and functions. 
2. **Intermediate Scala Tutorial**: 🧑‍💻 Covers classes, objects, collections, and pattern matching.
3. **Advanced Scala Tutorial**: ⚡ Delves into higher-order functions, for-comprehensions, concurrency with Futures, and tail recursion.

## Prerequisites ⚙️

Before you start using the tutorials, make sure you have **Scala** installed on your system. 

### Installing Scala 🛠️

Follow these steps to install Scala on your machine:

1. **Download and Install Java**:
   Scala requires Java to run. You can download the latest version of Java from the official website: https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html
   Install it according to your operating system.

2. **Install Scala**:
   To install Scala, follow the steps below:

   - **Using SDKMAN** (recommended for Linux/macOS):
     - Open your terminal and install SDKMAN:
       ```bash
       curl -s "https://get.sdkman.io" | bash
       source "$HOME/.sdkman/bin/sdkman-init.sh"
       sdk install scala
       ```
   - **Manual Installation**:
     - Download the latest Scala version from the official website: https://www.scala-lang.org/download/
     - Follow the instructions based on your operating system.

3. **Verify Installation** ✅:
   After installing Scala, open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command:
   ```bash
   scala -version
   ```
   You should see the installed version of Scala.
